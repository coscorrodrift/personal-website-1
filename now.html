  <h1>Now</h1>
  <p>I'm making this "Now" page in the spirit of the <a href="https://aboutideasnow.com/about">about-ideas-now</a> site, it's a page about the things I'm doing now, my current projects, and/or the things on my mind in the very short-term future.</p>

  <h2>Youtube</h2>
  <p>i still upload videos thinking about my life pretty regularly, and i stream every day basically.</p>
  <p>lately i feel like my streams are very boring because i don't really plan a topic for them and just improvise something before. the problem is that the ideas that i do have are some that i don't feel like i want to work on, i don't really feel connected to my "youtube image" anymore, it's not something i feel like "working on" in a more serious way, so in the meantime i guess i am just publicly boring instead lol. </p>
  <p>i guess it's a bad idea bc it makes the channel "noisy" but if my mind is noisy i feel like my channel should reflect that</p>
  
  <h2>Job</h2>
  <p>I failed at the interview i mentioned in the past update and i got quite disheartened by it.</p>
  <p>the strategy in my mind is now to get a job abroad that has accomodation included, no matter the kind of job. </p>

  <h2>Trip to Spa</h2>
  <p>it's next week. a friend is coming to spain for the 2nd time in the summer and 5 of us are going to a small town that is famous for like, natural baths etc, for a weekend.</p>

  <h2>Anki</h2>
  <p>I'm trying to do a geography Anki deck every day. it's the <a href="https://github.com/anki-geo/ultimate-geography#custom-study">ultimate geography</a> deck </p>

  <p>i guess i want to just be better at knowing at least some basic stuff througout the world. my weakest areas are the whole continent of africa and the middle east, and central and southeast asia. although i'm not perfect in central america and northern-south america either.</p>
