  <h1>Now</h1>
  <p>I'm making this "Now" page in the spirit of the <a href="https://aboutideasnow.com/about">about-ideas-now</a> site, it's a page about the things I'm doing now, my current projects, and/or the things on my mind in the very short-term future.</p>

  <h2>Job</h2>
  <p>I signed up to a program to become a train driver, so now i'll be learning german until March 2025, then i will be learning the train driving things for like, 15 months, then i will be a train driver for 2 years.</p>
  <p>I give some reasons/more context on why i signed up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRmuo8QWBXU">here</a> but basically, as i said in the previous iteration of this page, i was looking for jobs with accomodation and this one fit the bill + getting paid to learn german is a bonus + it aligns with my goals of getting as many vehicle licenses as possible.</p>

  <h3>Learning German</h3>

<p>Right now we're at B1 class, mostly explanations in Spanish but there's some German spoken in the classroom. I technically already have a B1 level but i feel more or less within the level of the class. </p>
  <p>The teacher I have now (which used to be only on fridays in the A2 days) was a train driver too so he gives us some documents and talks to us about the railway sector in german. </p>
  
  <h4>Anki</h4>
  <p>In the last update i mentioned anki to learn geography stuff, now i'm using it for german. just vocabulary from our material. i'm using <a href="https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/german-anki-template/">this template</a> for the cards, works decently. </p>
  <p>i should start making B1 vocabulary cards, haven't started yet with that. i tend to put off making cards, because it's a difficult process, finding an example sentence and image that fits, etc. </p>
  
  <h2>Youtube</h2>
  <p>now i only stream on the weekends because of the german course, and i stream for less hours (more like 1h vs the 1h30 that i used to do) bc i usually play pubg after, but i don't think i've missed a weekend, so i'm keeping it consistent within the constraints i have.</p>
  <p>they're still not super planned streams and are more or less weekly recaps, but i do some of my usual thinking out loud so i think they're a positive thing. </p>
  <p>i do think (and i also mentioned it on stream lol) that i feel stupider/lack ideas, maybe before the course etc i would've thought that "doing things" like, going to a german course, etc. would've made me have more ideas but it has not been the case.</p>

  <h2>Test drive</h2>
  <p>I signed up for a test drive of an Alpine car, let's see how it goes, if they even remember we scheduled it lol.</p>
  <p>I think it's a little step towards giving more gas (hehe) to my Coches Curiosos project, but who knows.</p>
