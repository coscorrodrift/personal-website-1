  <h1>Now</h1>
  <p>I'm making this "Now" page in the spirit of the <a href="https://aboutideasnow.com/about">about-ideas-now</a> site, it's a page about the things I'm doing now, my current projects, and/or the things on my mind in the very short-term future.</p>

  <h2>Youtube</h2>
  <p>i upload videos thinking about my life pretty regularly, and i stream every day basically.</p>
  <p>this may change depending on the things below, but who knows</p>
  <p>some channels i watch a lot lately are Mateo Y Lisanna, Guille Alfons√≠n, and if you check my channel out you will probably see that i make video responses to channels i encounter quite often</p>
  <h2>Job</h2>
  <p>i have a job interview tomorrow, for covering a maternity leave in some kind of consulting position, it'd last like 8 months</p>
  <p>i think i have high chances of getting it, i've talked about my feelings on the first Teams interview on  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhZrV5uPjmo">this video</a>, mixed feelings regarding the position but i'll probs take it  </p>

  <h2>Taylor Swift concert</h2>
  <p>it's in 2 weeks, 29th of may i think</p>
  <p>im kinda nervous bc i may have a job so idk how that will interface with it, maybe i'll be tired, or in a rush to get there, o tired the next day, i don't know</p>
  <p>also there will be way too many people which is overwhelming. and im going with a friend and his gf and im not sure what the plan is and how the situation will be tbh</p>
