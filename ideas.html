  <h1>Ideas</h1>
  <p>I'm making this "Ideas" page in the spirit of the <a href="https://aboutideasnow.com/about">about-ideas-now</a> site, it's a page about the things I'd like to do/see happening in the future</p>

  <h2>Bucket list</h2>
  <p>this section is inspired by <a href="https://piszek.com/bucketlist/">Artur Piszek's bucketlist</a>, I probably found it through his wife <a href="https://twitter.com/made_in_cosmos">MadeInCosmos</a> </p>
  <p>I have a twitter thread of stuff i'd like to do called "<a href="https://twitter.com/Coscorrodrift/status/1619372097863827457">Things i want</a>" so here they are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>to have a little car collection, and a media engine behind it to leverage it for online attention and to act as a little hub for telling stories about cars and the people behind them ( <a href="https://twitter.com/Coscorrodrift/status/1512972725240881158">tweet</a>) </li>
  <li>to have a coffee or tea in the balkans ( <a href="https://x.com/Coscorrodrift/status/1619377252478910470">tweet</a> ) and while there take a look and/or stay in <a href="https://x.com/Coscorrodrift/status/1619379975941148675">brutalist buildings</a> </li>

    <li><a href="https://x.com/Coscorrodrift/status/1447608466730848256">Go to a drifting event in Ebisu</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/Coscorrodrift/status/1447607953201242113">Drive a Touristenfahrt on the NÃ¼rburgring</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/Coscorrodrift/status/1447611892466438144">Go back to the karaoke bar in Munich</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/Coscorrodrift/status/1656784189117673472"></a>Go to the old Avus circuit tribunes in Berlin</li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/Coscorrodrift/status/1621937293140398080">Go to the comedy cellar in NYC</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/Coscorrodrift/status/1669392906078093312">Go to Bucees</a>
    <ul>
      <li>another gas station i want to go to now is  <a href=" https://maps.app.goo.gl/ETopPaqjbK2dQE2B8"> the John Wick gas station</a></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
   <li><a href="https://x.com/Coscorrodrift/status/1748708601491775575">Drive a Dodge Charger through Cheddar Gorge</a></li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Places i want to go to </h3>
  <p>this is a subsection of the bucketlist, that has less activity oriented things and more "just places to see"</p>
 <p>there are probably some places in my bucketlist that i could move here, and viceversa though</p>
  <p>This is <a href="/places.html">the link to the page</a> (it's a markdown page from my personal obsidian vault that i've converted to html, therefore there may be things in spanish, broken image links, things that only make sense to me, etc. i'll bring the "highlights here" at some point) </p>

  <h2>List of unfinished business</h2>
  <p>My <a href="list-of-unfinished-business.html">list of unfinished business</a> is a collection of ideas i've had and haven't finished executing on.  </p>
  <p>i write them out in case someone wants to steal them, give tips or ideas on how to finish them, help me finish them, give me encouragement on some and discouragement on others, etc.</p>
