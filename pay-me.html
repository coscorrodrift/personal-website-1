      <summary>Youtube Channel report</summary>
      <p>I will watch and analyze your videos (or a set of them) and write a report on them.</p>
      <p>You can find the "pitch" on <a href="https://coscorrodrift.eth.limo/">this website of mine</a> , basically, I have watched a ton of YouTube in an attentive and conscious way and I think I’ve picked up an eye for what the different kinds of “meta” are and the principles behind them. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T-7T5j_LuU&t=53s">I’ve learned some of the ways</a>  some people I admire do it and I believe I can help implement this for others. (My personal process looks different for particular reasons, but I still think my perspective can help others even if I don't apply it myself)</p>
      <p>I have also written a ton of words (over 100k, just counting comments over 1000 characters long) in feedback in YouTube comment sections over the years with a positive response.
