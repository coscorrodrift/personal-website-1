      <summary>Youtube Channel report</summary>
      <p>I will watch and analyze your videos (or a set of them) and write a report on them.</p>
      <p>You can find the "pitch" on <a href="https://coscorrodrift.eth.limo/">this website of mine</a> , basically, I have watched a ton of YouTube in an attentive and conscious way and I think I’ve picked up an eye for what the different kinds of “meta” are and the principles behind them. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T-7T5j_LuU&t=53s">I’ve learned some of the ways</a>  some people I admire do it and I believe I can help implement this for others. (My personal process looks different for particular reasons, but I still think my perspective can help others even if I don't apply it myself)</p>
      <p>I have also written a ton of words (over 100k, just counting comments over 1000 characters long) in feedback in YouTube comment sections over the years with a positive response.

      <p> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TQNgJspQRFP0hNO6qObjX-Yt1ZNoudVI3riwkwzbsok/edit?usp=sharing">This</a> is an example of what a report could look like (this was done based on a short channel overview and one video)</p>

        <summary>Video editing</summary>
        <p>I have edited video for clients I found on twitter, both for posting on socials and youtube videos</p>
        <p>This is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUEviuH1fxeCQRj2EYh85XPasCrSFLCgk">my video reel playlist</a>  with examples of longform, shortform, more casual, more professional edits.</p>

        <summary>Fund a video idea of mine</summary>
        <p>I have several ideas that I'd like to record if I had the funding:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Getting the Panera Death Lemonade in NYC: <a href="https://x.com/Coscorrodrift/status/1733137064630038893?s=20">this is my thread explaining it</a> </li>
          <li>Trip to eastern europe: based  <a href="https://x.com/Coscorrodrift/status/1619377252478910470?s=20">on this tweet</a>, just a trip exploring whether that particular stereotype is true and visiting brutalist/soviet era buildings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I don't have any reward planned but if you have a company or a project I would gladly put you as title sponsor, or if you're just an individual as some kind of "producer" role</p>
      </details>
      <li><details>
        <summary>Various experiments</summary>
  <p>I'm also open to experiments.</p>
        <p>An example of an online gig experiment i did is my dive into <a href="https://www.twitter.com/visakanv">visa's</a> archives.</p>
<p>He commissioned me to review 40 posts from his 1000 Word Vomits project. I assessed the posts, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YT--9jdFpxhX_YHykSKCR5ZRNrJVvR8q0ReyyRKM4XY/edit">commenting on individual posts</a> directly as well as producing a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aMjgnzHowDn7EqRCp1vaRF4qBq-UnbdtvI5EjdEesd4/edit">one-page summary</a> of my observations.</p>
