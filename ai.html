  <!-- MAIN STUFF -->

  <h1>AI</h1>
  <p>this is a page about how i use ai. it was inspired by <a href="https://briandavidhall.com/ai/">Brian's AI page</a></p>
  
  <h2>My AI policy in this website</h2>

  <p>I don't really have a defined AI policy for my website. I say "manually updated with love" on the bottom of my site because i edit the files on html myself on replit, instead of using some WYSIWYG editor, but despite that claim, I've used AI on some of my pages:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="/list-of-unfinished-business.html">My list of unfinished business</a> was made using ChatGPT (GPT-4) from some bulletpoints I gave . I don't say "manually updated with love" in that one tho.</li>
    <li><a href="my-life-story.html">My life story</a> was made using AI to transcribe the text (Deepgram). It's a video transcript that hasn't been manually revised (I think it's obvious). I think that one does say "manually updated with love", even tho it was mostly copying and pasting, because there's something I've written at the beginning IIRC. Plus I spoke those words, I guess. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My AI policy in general</h2>
  <p>I don't like AI generated text often, the list of unfinished business was made with AI and I can easily tell that it doesn't sound like me. But it is a list of unfinished business, so it's unpolished on purpose. </p>

  <p>But I use AI often to talk to it and ask it questions, I've talked to ChatGPT (GPT4 and 4o), Claude (3.5) and lately Perplexity Pro to ask both "general knowledge"/curiosity related questions, but also to "talk stuff out" with personal issues. I also think it's useful for languages, translating stuff like song lyrics from Japanese, and I plan to use it for writing emails in German to get jobs...</p>

  <p>I've used AI (Stable Diffusion, DALLÂ·E 2 and 3 in ChatGPT) to generate thumbnails or thumbnail assets for my youtube channel sometimes. I'd have no qualms in using them way more often if I liked the results but I don't fully like them yet. If I get money maybe I'll consider using stuff like PhotoAI or get a custom model with my face trained.</p>

  <p>I watch "the AI space", and when text to video becomes good + affordable I'll probably use it for some stuff, but I think the "alpha" in videos is in being real so probably not too often/to illustrate points. </p>
